# Search-Engine-Optimization-Challenge

# Description 
This website was created with the purpose of meeting accessibility standards so that it is optimized for search engines. This will make it easier to come across this website when people search for keywords that are contained within the website. In turn, this will earn inbound links to increase the website's content rankings and visibility making it easier to find and access. In refactoring the starter code, I have learned that it is better to use semantic HTML elements and comments when creating a codebase so that it is easier for developers reviewing my work to better understand my thought process.
